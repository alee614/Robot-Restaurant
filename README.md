# Robot-Restaurant
COMP271 Assessment

RoboRestaurantTester.java is my tester file that allows the "robot" to add customers into their log and keep track of their check.

Assumptions:

Orders are not added onto the cost of the check until the order has been delievered from the kitchen to the customer.
Customer only orders items on the menu.
If the customer orders multiples of an item, they will recieve them all at once (aka if you order 3 bobas and the robot says they were delivered, all 3 of them were delivered).
